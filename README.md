# Polya's Game
This program is an exploration of ergodicity using Polya's Game.

Polya's game is a probabilistic process involving balls of two colors: red and blue. The game starts with an initial number of red and blue balls in a single urn. At each step:

1. A ball is randomly drawn from the urn.
2. The drawn ball is replaced with two balls of the same color.

This process is repeated for a large number of steps, and the game is used to study the long-term behavior of the system, particularly its ergodicity.
